## Network

This area is used for network learning, mainly is have Cisco PacketTracer handon labs to learn the commands and syntex needed to setup bacis IOS devices.



Folder "Cisco PacketTracer" contains the specific handson labs that are made. At the moment the labs do NOT have self checking abilities. This will be added in a later process. As main focus is to generate content.



Each handson lab will have a "README.md" to define specific requirements and notes to execute the task, also a picture will be added to see the topology before running the files.
