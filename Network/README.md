## Network

This area is used for network learning, main content is Cisco PacketTracer hands-on labs to learn the commands and syntax needed to setup basic IOS devices.



Folder "Cisco PacketTracer" contains the specific hands-on labs that are made. At the moment the labs do NOT have self checking abilities. This will be added in a later process. As main focus is to generate content.

Folder "Assignment Labs" contains labs for testing other subjects, like making a IP Plan etc 


Each hands-on lab will have a "README.md" to define specific requirements and notes to execute the task, also a picture will be added to see the topology before running the files.
